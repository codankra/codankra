## codankra and Tewwie
👋 Hi my name is codankra = **c**reative **o**perations of **dan**iel **kra**mer 😁 

🧑‍💻 I founded a software startup **Tewwie** to build tools that make complex financial systems more accessible to everyone!
- 🛋️ 🚚 An agent for sharing used furniture (cross-listing, dynamically pricing, selling and moving)
- 💸 🏦 An organizer making it fun and simple to earn bank bonuses
- 🏷️🛒 A crowd-sourced grocery price tracker (This one's [live in public](openpricedata.com), and free and open source [here on GitHub](https://github.com/codankra/openprices))

### 🔍 What You'll Find Here

🗃️ Secret projects aside, I use GitHub for...
- 📖 Creating a history of projects I've worked on since college
- ⭐ Bookmarking setups and other great software for use and inspiration
- 🌐 Hosting code for one-off tools I (mostly AI/vibe) build where the user is me. If other people find relevance or usefulness in them that's an unexpected bonus! 
	- 🎨 Stuff like [mint-whisper](https://github.com/codankra/mint-whisper) (speech to text for my specific linux distro/version) and [formality](https://github.com/codankra/formality) (auto-completion of common repetitive browser form info)
